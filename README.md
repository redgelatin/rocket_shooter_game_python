# Rocket Shooter Game Using Python
Simple shooter-based game for novice python programmers.

## About my project
I developed this quick shooter-based game to experiment with Github because I am new to it. This will be a side project during
my free time as I learn how to use Github. Feel free to contribute in any way you like. The project was coded using Python 2.7.6.

##Enhancements
These are things that should be added to improve the game:
* Main Menu
* Power-ups
* Accurate hitboxes
